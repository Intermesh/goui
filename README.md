Group-Office User Interface
===========================

Welcome to the GOUI (Group-Office User Interface) git repository. Developed using 
[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/), GOUI aims to create stunning and 
efficient web applications.

GOUI was designed to replace the outdated ExtJS 3.4 framework utilized in [Group-Office](https://www.group-office.com).
However, it is not limited to Group-Office alone. This versatile framework can be seamlessly integrated into any 
JavaScript or TypeScript project.
